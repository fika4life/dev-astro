# UX Research Portfolio

My personal blog and UX Research portfolio. The site features articles and projects related to her work in user experience research, design thinking, and human-centered design. The content seems to focus on sharing insights, experiences, and methodologies from her professional career.

## Technologies used

This website is built using Astro.js, a modern web framework for building fast, scalable, and secure websites. The styling is done using Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework that allows for rapid development and customization. The content of this website, including this post, is written in Markdown, a lightweight markup language that makes it easy to write and format content.

## Reflections

This was my first time using Astro.js. It was my first time using the framework and I found it to be quite easy to use, especiallly compared to using Nextjs, I found it straigthforward and intuitive. I followed the [Brad Traversy course on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAAkCSZUG1c) and found it to be a comprehensive introduction to the framework.

I opted for an [Astro theme](https://astro.build/themes/details/aria/) because I actually needed to create the content in the website so didn't have so much time to develop the site from scratch. But I made a lot of aesthetic changes and added more color.

I hope to use with this framework more in the future. A lot of tutorials are in Nextjs, but I found Astro a lot more enjoyable to use.
